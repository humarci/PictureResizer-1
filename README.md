# PictureResizer
Picture Resizer for Windows

Lets you resize images in a batch:
1. It allows you to drag and drop any files or folders into the UI;
2. It can iterate through all the sub-folders and find all the image files;
3. You can resize by specific ratio; and if only one file is selected, you can also resize by entering exact dimension of the image.
